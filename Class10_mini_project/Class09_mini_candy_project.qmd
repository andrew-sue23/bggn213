Today we will analyze some data from about 538 typical halloween candy.

Our first job is to get the data into R.

```{r}
candy_file<- read.csv("candy-data.csv", row.names =1)
head(candy_file)
candy<- candy_file
```

> Q. How many chocolate candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$chocolate)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

There are 9 types of candy.

```{r}
head(candy)
```

> Q2. How many fruit candy are there?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

> Q. How many total candy?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q. How many variables/dimensions are there?

```{r}
ncol(candy)
dim(candy)
```

Skimr package allows for a peak/report of your dataset.

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Haribo Gold Bears",]$winpercent
```

> Q. What are the five least liked candy's in the dataset?

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)

head(candy[inds,])
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The last 3 columns are all percent values compared to the logical values within the candy types.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy\$chocolate column?

It represents whether that particular candy has chocolate in it or not. (1 is yes, 0 is no)

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth=8)

hist(candy$winpercent)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No it is skewed to the left. \> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The center of the distribution is below 50% \> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

First find all chocolate candy and all fruit candy. Take the mean of the winpercent values. Compare.

```{r}
chocolate<- subset(candy,chocolate == 1)
fruity <- subset(candy,fruity == 1)

choco_mean <-mean(chocolate$winpercent)
fruity_mean <- mean(fruity$winpercent)
```

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

Yes it is.

```{r}
t.test(chocolate$winpercent,fruity$winpercent)
```

# Overall candy rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
head(candy[inds,])
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
inds_2 <- rev(inds)
head(candy[inds_2,])
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) + 
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) + 
  geom_col()

ggsave("barplot1.png", height =10, width =7)
```

We can now insert any image using markdown syntax. This is ! followed by square brackets and then normal parenthesis.

![A dull plot](barplot1.png){#fig-gray}

@fig-gray

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x = "Match-up Win percent", y = NULL)
```

Lets add some color.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent), fill = chocolate) + 
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Match-up Win percent", y = NULL)
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent), fill = as.factor(chocolate)) + 
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Match-up Win percent", y = NULL)
```

We need to make our own color vactor with the colors we like.

```{r}
#you need this default vector set to every value within dataset and then we manually rewrite it afterwards. 
my_cols <- rep("black", nrow(candy)) 

my_cols[ as.logical(candy$chocolate) ] <- "brown"
my_cols[ as.logical(candy$fruity) ] <- "red"
my_cols[ as.logical(candy$bar) ] <- "chocolate"
my_cols[ as.logical(candy$caramel) ] <- "tan"
```

Because we mapped my_cols to our dataset, we cannot set the aesthetic in the typical aes() portion of ggplot. It needs to go to the geom\_()

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) + 
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) +
  labs(x = "Match-up Win percent", y = NULL)

ggsave("barplot2.png", height =10, width =7)
```

![This is where you can put caption text](barplot2.png){#fig-bar}

As shown in @fig-bar there is terrible colors choices.

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

The worst chocolate candy is Sixlets. \> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

The worst fruity candy is Nik L Nip.

#Take a look at pricepercent Lets make a plot of winpercent vs pricepercent. the original idea with this is to show what is the best candy for your money.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label =rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text(col=my_cols)
```

These labels suck so lets try making a new one using ggrepel.

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label =rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols)
```

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label =rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size = 4, max.overlaps = 8)
```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reece's miniatures are the best bang for your buck. Highest win percent but still low pricepercent. However, using the code below, you would pick tootsie roll midgies.

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = FALSE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

##explore the correlation within the candy data.

```{r}
cij<-cor(candy)
```

```{r}
head(cij)
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)

corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and Fruity is anti-correlated. \> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and winpercent or bar are positively correlated.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = TRUE)
attributes(pca)
```

```{r}
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
pc.score.results<- as.data.frame(pca$x)
head(pc.score.results)

ggplot(pc.score.results) +
  aes(PC1,PC2, label =rownames(pc.score.results))+
  geom_point(col = my_cols)+
  geom_text_repel(col = my_cols, max.overlaps = 8)+
  labs(title="PCA Candy Space", 
       subtitle = "Chocolate and fruity candy plot")
```

#Loading plots

```{r}
pc.loadings <-as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(pc.loadings) + 
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pc.loadings),PC1)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruit, pluribus, and hard are all correlated together (right half) vs Chocolate and the other factors (left half) are correlated with the most correlated from bottom up.
